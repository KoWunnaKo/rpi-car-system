RPI-CAR-SYSTEM
==============

This project aim to create a full-featured headunit.

At this stage, the project is really simply and had the following components:

- build-os/build-all.sh : Bash script that downloads all needed packages and create a system tarball
- build-os/flash-all.sh : Bash script that flash the tarballs into a SD-Card (for the rpi boot system)
